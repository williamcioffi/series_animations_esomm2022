  <p>Three animals tagged together, with cee marked in purple, and showing the split. It's funny it makes them still look pretty synchronous with the split, but it is an illusion I think. I could leave them all in the same panel but it gets pretty chaotic. Just a mockup, I realize some of those colors are horrendus and also the y axis needs to be a little deeper. Also I'm missing 2 frames at the end. Also don't panic the labels are wrong for the whales.</p>

  <p>Two animals tagged separately that came together and stayed together for quite a while. Just a short view of a couple of days around the join. Lines could probably stand to be thicker, but just a mockup again.</p>

 <p>Just another version with the dots and nicer looking lines.</p>
